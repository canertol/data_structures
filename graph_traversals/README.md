main.cpp program implements both BFT and DFT algorithms to traverse a given graph.
 Input is a text file named “edges.txt”, in which resides an adjacency matrix representing a graph with exactly 6 vertices, which are ordered as (A, B, C, D, E, F).
 The starting vertex for traversal is always “A”.
 
 'optional_destination.cpp' takes a char input from the user to set the destination vertex and prints out two paths from the starting
vertex “A” to the given destination: One found with BFS algorithm and the other with DFS. Rename the file as main.cpp, if you want to use it.
